### ATTENTION: this will change which casadi file we will use for optimization
### You first need to generate panther_compute_cost.casadi by running main.m with 
### optimize_n_planes=false, optimize_d_planes=false, and optimize_time_alloc=false. (which is now done by use_panther_star=false)
### Don't forget to change the compute_cost.save() line from compute_cost.casadi to panther_compute_cost.casadi
